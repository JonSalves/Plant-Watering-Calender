Hey There!

This is my first time writing a README so please bear with me. 

I created this plant watering calnder that tells you which plants need watering on which days. Well who doesnt want a reminder for watering their plants?

The Calender is a simple display of Date, Month, Year, Day and a section for the plant names. I added 2 buttons for navigating forward and backwords on the calender. I used a nice green background for the body so it looks like grass. I aslo ensured the display was in the center of the screen. 

I decided to use HTML,CSS and JavaScript for the project as i have some experience with the technologies. 

Overall i am a little dissapointed with the project as i feel like there are a lot of improvements that could be made but due to a short time for improvements this will do. 

I Do plan on revsiting and improving the project to have some inputs from the users and i also want to utilise local storage in the future. 

I had a few moments where i was stuck and overthinking the project that ended up costing me a lot of time(at one point I realised i was making 2 different projects.). But now I know that I can make the project a little better and more user friendly. 

Having rambled on for soo long I hope this project meets your expectations. 

Have Fun!!
